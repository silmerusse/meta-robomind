OpenEmbedded/Yocto BSP layer for Robomind distro
================================================================

This layer provides support for Robomind distro and MarS Board for
use with OpenEmbedded and/or Yocto Freescale's BSP layer.

This layer depends on Freescale Community BSP master HEAD.

HOW TO USE:
- Please clone or copy this layer into Freescale Community BSP directory. 
- Run 'source setup-environment build' to setup environment.
- Edit conf/local.conf and ensure MACHINE is set to 'marsboard', DISTRO is set to 'robomind'.
- Edit conf/bblayers.conf and ensure BBLAYERS includes 'meta-robomind'. If you are going to build robomind-image-gui you may need to include xfce, gnome and filesystems layers for dependency.
- Run 'bitbake <image_name>' to bake the image.

robomind-image-gui provides xfce as default desktop environment.
robomind-image-core does not include X11 and xfce.
